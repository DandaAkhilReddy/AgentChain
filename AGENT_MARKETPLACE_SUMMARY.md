# 🏪 AgentChain v2.0 - Agent Marketplace & Enhanced Tokenomics

## 🔥 **Token Burning Mechanics**

### **Automatic Burns (2% on every transfer):**
- User A sends 1000 MIND to User B
- 20 MIND (2%) burned automatically
- User B receives 980 MIND
- Total supply decreases by 20 MIND

### **Marketplace Example:**
- Agent listed for 1000 MIND
- Buyer pays 1000 MIND
- 20 MIND (2%) marketplace fee
- 980 MIND sent to seller
- Additional ~19.6 MIND burned on seller transfer
- Total burn: ~39.6 MIND per marketplace transaction

### **Long-Term Impact:**
- **Starting Supply**: 1,000,000,000 MIND
- **After 1M transactions**: ~980,000,000 MIND (-2%)
- **After 10M transactions**: ~800,000,000 MIND (-20%)
- **After 50M transactions**: ~400,000,000 MIND (-60%)
- **Result**: Remaining tokens become increasingly valuable!

## 📊 **Market Dynamics**

### **Agent Value Factors:**
