# üîê KAMIKAZE Zero-Knowledge Proof Protocols

## Overview
The KAMIKAZE Token ecosystem implements state-of-the-art zero-knowledge proof protocols to ensure complete privacy while maintaining public verifiability. This document explains the cryptographic protocols used and how to interact with them.

## üèóÔ∏è Core ZK Architecture

### Cryptographic Primitives
- **Hash Function**: Poseidon (ZK-friendly hash optimized for circuits)
- **Commitment Scheme**: Pedersen commitments with random blinding factors
- **Proof System**: Groth16 zk-SNARKs for efficient verification
- **Elliptic Curve**: BN254/BN128 for pairing-friendly operations
- **Field**: Prime field Fr for circuit compatibility

### Privacy Guarantees
1. **Zero-Knowledge**: No sensitive information revealed during proof verification
2. **Soundness**: Invalid statements cannot be proven (cryptographic security)
3. **Completeness**: Valid statements can always be proven
4. **Non-Interactive**: Proofs can be verified without prover interaction

## üîë ZK Proof Types Implemented

### 1. Balance Proofs
**Purpose**: Prove ownership of KAMIKAZE tokens without revealing exact amounts
```
Commitment = Poseidon(balance, randomness)
```
**Use Cases**:
- Private balance tracking
- Anonymous transaction validation
- Confidential payment verification

### 2. Range Proofs  
**Purpose**: Prove a value is within a range without revealing the exact value
```
Proof: balance ‚àà [min_range, max_range]
```
**Use Cases**:
- Reputation scores (prove 80-100% without exact score)
- Performance metrics (prove "high quality" without exact rating)
- Income verification (prove above threshold)

### 3. Membership Proofs
**Purpose**: Prove membership in a set without revealing which member
```
Merkle_Root = BuildTree(membership_set)
Proof = GenerateMerkleProof(secret, tree)
```
**Use Cases**:
- Whitelist verification
- Access control
- Anonymous group membership

### 4. Staking Proofs
**Purpose**: Prove staking participation without revealing amounts or duration
```
Stake_Commitment = Poseidon(amount, randomness_1)
Period_Commitment = Poseidon(lock_period, randomness_2)
```
**Use Cases**:
- Private staking validation
- Anonymous reward distribution
- Confidential governance participation

### 5. Task Completion Proofs
**Purpose**: Verify task completion and quality without revealing work details
```
Quality_Commitment = Poseidon(quality_score, randomness)
Task_Proof = ZK_Proof(task_id, agent_id, quality_commitment)
```
**Use Cases**:
- Anonymous quality verification
- Private performance tracking
- Confidential work validation

## üîß API Integration Guide

### Generate Commitment
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/zk/generate-commitment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "value": "1000",
    "randomness": "optional_custom_randomness"
  }'
```

### Generate Range Proof
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/zk/range-proof \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "value": 85,
    "min_range": 0,
    "max_range": 100,
    "commitment": "your_commitment_hash"
  }'
```

### Verify Proof
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/zk/verify-proof \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "proof_type": "range_proof",
    "proof": "proof_string",
    "public_signals": ["commitment", "range_min", "range_max"]
  }'
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Protection Mechanisms

### 1. Balance Privacy
- All KAMIKAZE balances stored as commitments
- Transaction amounts remain private
- Only range proofs reveal if balance is sufficient
- Burn amounts proven but not revealed

### 2. Transaction Privacy  
- Transfer amounts use zero-knowledge proofs
- Nullifiers prevent double-spending
- Transaction graph analysis resistant
- Timing correlation protection

### 3. Staking Privacy
- Stake amounts completely hidden
- Lock periods remain confidential
- Rewards calculated on commitments
- APY applied to private amounts

### 4. Agent Performance Privacy
- Earnings amounts commitment-based
- Quality scores proven in ranges only
- Task completion rates private
- Reputation building anonymous

## üîí Security Model

### Threat Protection
‚úÖ **Balance enumeration attacks**  
‚úÖ **Transaction graph analysis**

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "proofs": ["proof1", "proof2", "proof3"]

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/zk/membership-proof \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
