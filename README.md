   npm run deploy:testnet -- --network mumbai
   ```

2. **Base Testnet** - FREE  
   - Ethereum L2 with low fees
   - Good for production testing
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:testnet -- --network baseTestnet
   ```

3. **Polygon Mainnet** - ~$0.01/tx

## ðŸ“± Frontend Integration

### Web3 Connection
```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Connect to contracts
const mindToken = new ethers.Contract(MIND_ADDRESS, MIND_ABI, signer);
const agentNFT = new ethers.Contract(AGENT_ADDRESS, AGENT_ABI, signer);
const marketplace = new ethers.Contract(MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS, MARKETPLACE_ABI, signer);

// Example: Create a task
const tx = await marketplace.createTask(
  "Translate document",
  "Translate English to Spanish", 
  "QmHash...", // IPFS hash
  0, // Translation category
  ethers.utils.parseEther("10"), // 10 MIND reward
  86400, // 24 hours
  false, // not urgent
  70, // min 70% performance
  ["translation", "spanish"] // required capabilities
);
```

### Transaction Examples
```javascript
// Mint an AI agent
await agentNFT.mintAgent(
  userAddress,
  "TranslatorBot",
  ["translation", "nlp", "communication"]
);

// Claim a task
await marketplace.claimTask(taskId, agentTokenId);

// Transfer MIND tokens
await mindToken.transfer(recipient, amount);
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Deployment Fails**
```bash
# Ensure sufficient gas
export GAS_LIMIT=5000000

# Check network connection
npx hardhat node --fork https://polygon-rpc.com
```

**Tests Fail**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf cache artifacts node_modules
npm install
npm run compile
```

**High Gas Costs**
- Use testnet first (free)
- Deploy during low network congestion
- Consider Polygon for 100x cheaper gas
